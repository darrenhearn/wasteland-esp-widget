Playing with ESP8266 as Arduino device

Setting up this branch for tinkering with:

- Hardware 1-Wire support via DS2482-100 (via I2C)
- 1-Wire protocol (see http://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN3684.pdf and http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS2482-100.pdf for general notes about using the DS2482 -- also http://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN187.pdf for notes about the 1-Wire search algorithm).
